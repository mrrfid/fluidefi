### INTRODUCTION 
FLUIDEFIÂ® is an award-winning platform that provides near real-time <sup><a name="footnote1">1</a></sup> compliant & auditable analytics, portfolio management, and alerting for thousands of decentralized financial (DeFi) digital assets. FLUIDEFI's metrics are calculated using blockchain transaction logs, not third party APIs. FLUIDEFI is blockchain, network, and automatic market-maker (AMM) agnostic.

The FLUIDEFI RESTful API allows developers to:
- obtain detailed, accurate analytics of digital asset to identify investment opportunities across multiple blockchains, networks, and platforms;
- create portfolios of various digital assets from multiple platforms;
- model the portfolio's performance based on historical returns;
- optimize the balances of the portfolios to maximize future profitability;
- monitor and receive alerts when digital asset metrics reach specified values or change over periods of time;
- analyze the actual profit and loss of digital asset holdings including those spread across multiple portfolios (wallets);
- swap digital assets;
- add and remove liquidity from liquidity pools;

<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> The term "near real-time" refers to the time delay introduced by 1) automated data processing and 2) network transmission between the occurrence of an event and the request of the processed data (the API call). The API responses include <em>as_of_timestamp</em> that specifies the UTC date/time that the API response was generated and <em>last_processed</em> which includes the UTC date/time the information was last calculated. FLUIDEFI uses ISO 8601 format for datetimes.


### ACCESS TO THE FLUIDEFI API
Accessing the FLUIDEFI RESTful API requires:

1. A username and password. This information is provided when enrolling for the FLUIDEFI services. If you do not have an account, [contact us](https://fluidefi.com/#contact) to schedule a demonstration or get access.

2. The API endpoint to use. The API end-point will be in the form of a URL. For example: https://my-api.fluidefi.com  
> NOTE: **The API end-point URL for your account is provided when enrolling for the FLUIDEFI services.** Do not use the example listed.

3. Depending on your subscription level, the IP address(es) of your computer(s) making API requests may need to be <em>white-listed</em> with the FLUIDEFI network firewall. Please send an email with your username and the IP address(es) to be whitelisted to FLUIDEFI Support. Static IP addresses are recommended. Note: when using dynamic IP addresses, the FLUIDEFI firewall does not automatically update when your dynamic IP address changes.

All API requests must be made to your designated API URL using HTTPS protocol with TLS v1.3 or later via TCP/IP port 443. All FLUIDEFI servers use SSL certificates with sha256RSA signature algorithms issued by <em>Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA</em>. 

> It is important to note that some API calls can generate very long responses. Please review this documentation for performance recommendations.

### APR vs. APY: Whatâs the Difference?
Both annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR) refer to the annual return generated from an investment, but they do so in different ways.

APY takes into account the compounding effect, and reports the annual return using one piece of information: the annual return itself.
However, APR's calculation does not factor in compounding, and therefore reports the annual return using two pieces of information: the APR + the compounding frequency.

Here's an example of how both metrics are computed.
Assume that for the past month, the total return for an investment is 2%. We calculate APR and APY as follows: 
- APR = 2% * 12 = 24%
- APY = (1+2%)<sup>12</sup> -1 = 26.82%

In this case, APY > APR due to the compounding effect that is not taken into account by APR.

Also, note that these two statements are equivalent and both report how much return to expect in a year:
1. Annual return of this investment is 26.82%
2. This investment has an APR of 24%, compounded monthly

APY is the simpler way of reporting the same information. For this reason, <b>FLUIDEFI only provides APY figures</b>.

### SUPPORTED BASE CURRENCIES FOR CALCULATIONS
FLUIDEFI currently supports 12 fiat currencies, gold, silver, and 8,000+ cryptocurrencies. Examples: USD, WETH, GBP, CAD, CHF, JPY, AUD, NZD, HKD, EUR, NOK, SEK, SGD, CNY, KRW, XAU8, & XAG. If you need a fiat currency that is not listed here, contact support using the method below.

### PRECISION
FLUIDEFI supports a precision of 160, which is the size of sqrtX96 variable in many smart-contracts used vr DeFi platforms. The precision of a number is the total count of significant digits in the whole number, or, in other words, the number of digits to both sides of the decimal point. For example: the number 123.4567 has a precision of 7. It is not uncommon to have amounts displayed as 8 digits to the left of the decimal and 16 digits to the right.

### DateTime Format
FLUIDEFI supports ISO 8601 standard format date and datetimes. All datetimes are in UTC. The GET methods support YYYY-MM-DD. Example: "2021-06-01". POST methods support datetimes. Example: "2021-10-18T19:19:06.982417".

### Rate Limiting
Rate limits are based on your subscription level and vary between 5 and 60 calls per second.

### "Currently in Alpha" and "Currently in Beta"
From time to time, the FLUIDEFI documentation may indicate an API call or parameter is currently in Alpha or Beta. "Currently in Beta" functionality is available to FLUIDEFI customers with access to our staging environment. "Currently in Alpha" functionality is available upon request to FLUIDEFI customers with dedicated servers.

### STATUS CODES AND ERROR RESPONSES

All error responses have error code and a human-readable message. All error messages are in English.

200: Successful GET request

201-202: Successful PUT or POST request

204: Successful request, but the call did not generate any results to return.

400: Bad Request - Please check the parameters passed to the API call.
